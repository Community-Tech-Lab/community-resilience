Prepare for emergencies by building local capacity, empowering stakeholders with training, collaboratively developing inclusive Emergency Communications Plans (ECPs), and creating scalable, community-driven models for resilience.

## Activities & Outcomes

#### Build Local Capacity
- [ ] Identify and train local stakeholders as Digital Stewards to serve as Emergency Communication first responders.
- [ ] Equip stewards with the knowledge and skills to maintain and deploy PNKs effectively, including regular training and drills.
      
#### Collaborative Planning
- [ ] Facilitate community workshops to assess local assets, vulnerabilities, and communication challenges, integrating these insights into a draft Emergency Communications Plan (ECP).
- [ ] Develop a living document for the ECP that reflects the unique needs and capacities of the community and evolves with their input.
    
#### Accessible Plan
- [ ] Host the ECP on local mesh network servers and ensure it is accessible through PNKs in offline modes.
- [ ] Promote the ECP across community platforms, ensuring it is available in multiple languages and formats for inclusivity.
  
#### Scalable and Replicable Models
- [ ] Use the ECP as a template for other neighborhoods or organizations to develop their own emergency communication plans.
- [ ] Extend the local PNK network infrastructure to cover more key locations and offer additional stewardship opportunities.
