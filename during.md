During an emergency, swiftly deploy Portable Network Kits (PNKs) to critical hubs, maintain reliable connectivity for real-time updates and access to essential resources, and engage the community through clear and responsive communications.

### Activate Emergency Communication Protocols
  - [ ] Ensure swift deployment of PNKs to pre-identified community hubs and critical sites, prioritizing vulnerable populations.
  - [ ] Enable stewards to coordinate communication efforts, share real-time updates, and connect emergency responders with local residents.

### Provide Reliable Connectivity and Critical Info
  - [ ] Leverage PNKs to maintain internet access, messaging services, and information dissemination, ensuring critical communication lines remain operational.
  - [ ] Support offline access to emergency resources stored on the PNK servers, such as medical information, maps, and emergency contacts.

### Community Engagement
  - [ ] Use the PNK network to provide clear, multilingual communication to residents, emphasizing safety protocols and resource availability.
  - [ ] Ensure a responsive feedback loop during the emergency, allowing residents to share needs and updates via the PNK network.
