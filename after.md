After an emergency, conduct a thorough review to refine the Emergency Communication Plan (ECP), update resources, expand the PNK network, and sustain preparedness through community engagement and annual readiness drills.

### Conduct Post-Emergency Review
  - [ ] Organize debrief sessions with stewards and community members to evaluate the effectiveness of the PNK deployment and communication plan.
  - [ ] Collect and analyze data on PNK usage, communication patterns, and challenges faced during the emergency.

### Improve the ECP
  - [ ] Revise the Emergency Communication Plan based on lessons learned, ensuring it becomes more robust and reflective of community needs.
  - [ ] Update and refresh any PNK-stored content and resources to maintain relevance for future emergencies.

### Expand and Sustain
  - [ ] Strengthen the local PNK and mesh network infrastructure to include additional nodes and community sites.
  - [ ] Encourage ongoing stewardship by creating opportunities for community members to engage with and maintain the PNKs.

### Annual Readiness Check
  - [ ] Schedule yearly drills to rehearse emergency communication protocols and ensure equipment functionality.
  - [ ] Revisit and update the ECP annually, incorporating new technologies, community changes, and expanded network capacities.
