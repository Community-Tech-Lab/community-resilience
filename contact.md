## Map
This map shows the locations where Portable Network Kits (PNKs) have been deployed, as part of a growing network of community-driven resilience initiatives. Each pin represents a site where PNKs are actively used to enhance emergency communication, foster local connectivity, and empower communities to adapt to challenges.
